# Test AppStud Android Kotlin

## Intro
This is the repo created to do the AppStud test.
All directives are in directives folder.

## About the achievement
I spend my time to learn Kotlin and Android Native, but I'm proud of the result even if it's clearly not finished
Here, I give some improvement I wanted to make at the end of the test : 
- Use Dependency injection to have only 1 repo instance, and a global MusicService to use by all activities (Because now I had to use fragment)
- Manage HttpResponse with a seated class HttpResponse.Success / HttpResponse.Error
- Manage l10n for some text

## Summary
Thanks for this test, 
I'm really happy to understand how Native work to use it in Flutter App, 
I'm sure I have lot's of things to understand to use perfectly native Android dev but it was a good first approach.
